# Loan funding: a study covering the probability of credit defaults

## Objective of the project: 
The Lending Club platform is an American company that finances loans from individuals to individuals. As an alternative to bank financing but also to financial investment, this platform allows both the project realizations and a low-risk investment for the people granting the loans. However, to ensure this low risk, the allocation of loans must be optimized to avoid credit default. We will focus on this issue. Using two classification models, we will propose a segmentation of loan applicants in order to help investors in the selection of their financing. We will first present modifications to the data so that it is usable, robust and relevant. We will then use a logistic regression model, the main interest of which is to inform on the probabilistic impact of each variable on loan repayment. We will also proceed to a classification of individuals using a random forest classifier. Finally, we will present the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) which will be our main metric.
